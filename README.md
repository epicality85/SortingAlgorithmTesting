# SortingAlgorithmTesting

Here I am testing some implemtations of sorting algorithms that I am learning about in universty, as I am a current student.

The time approximations will follow, and operation counters will be added as well.

So far the types of algorithms tested are:\n
Bubble Sort\n
Double Selection\n
Single Selection (as a comparitor)
