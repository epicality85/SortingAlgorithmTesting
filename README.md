# SortingAlgorithmTesting

<p>Here I am testing some implemtations of sorting algorithms that I am learning about in universty, as I am a current student.</p>

<p>The time approximations will follow, and operation counters will be added as well.</p>

<p>So far the types of algorithms tested are: </br>
Bubble Sort</br>
Double Selection</br>
Single Selection (as a comparitor)</br></p>

<h3>Here are the values in a table</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
